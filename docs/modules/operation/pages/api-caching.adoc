= API Caching
:imagesdir: ../assets/images

The access to the *Velocloud Orchestrator* ReST APIs are rate-limited for its clients.
In order to respect these rate-limits, we use caching on API calls.

NOTE: The cache retention period can be altered by modifying the `cache.retention` configuration property.
