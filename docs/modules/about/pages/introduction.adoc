The *OpenNMS Velopcloud Plugin* allows to monitor the status and to collect events and performance metrics of *Velocloud* entities.

After installing the plugin, connections must be added by using the *Orchestrator URLs* and the associated *API Keys*.
After that, the *Velocloud* entities can be imported into an *OpenNMS* requisition.
Services will be bound for *Gateways*, *Edges* and *Links*.
Events will be collected and associated with nodes in *OpenNMS* and also performance metrics will be collected.
The next section will give a brief overview on the basic terminology of *Velocloud* before the installation and configuration procedures are shown in the next sections.
