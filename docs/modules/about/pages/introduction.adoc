The OpenNMS Velopcloud Plugin lets you monitor the status and collect events and performance metrics of Velocloud entities.

After installing the plugin, you must use the Orchestrator URLs and associated API keys to add connections.
After that, you can import the Velocloud entities into an OpenNMS requisition.
Services will be bound for gateways, edges, and links.
It then collects these events and associates them with nodes in OpenNMS, as well as collecting performance metrics.
The next section gives a brief overview of basic Velocloud terminology.
