= Connections
:imagesdir: ../assets/images

First of all we have to define the connections the plugin uses to connect to the *Orchestrator*.
The following example adds a connection with the alias `theAlias` and assumes, that the *Orchestrator* is reachable by the URL `https://my.velocloud.orchestrator.net` and the API-key is `tHiSiS.TheAP1Key`.
```
admin@opennms()> opennms-velocloud:connection-add theAlias https://my.velocloud.orchestrator.net/ tHiSiS.TheAP1Key
```

NOTE: In the case the connection represents a partner connection, you can list the associated customers by invoking `opennms-velocloud:list-customers aPartnerAlias`.
