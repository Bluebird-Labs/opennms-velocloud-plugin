In order to monitor the *Velocloud* Gateways, Edges and Links, these entities need to be imported into *OpenNMS*.
You can achieve this by creating a requisition for a given connection alias.
A connection alias can represent a customer connection or a partner connection.
While a customer connection only allows to query for entities associated with the customer itself, a partner connection has access to top-level entities that are shared by customers.
Furthermore, a partner connection allows also to be used as a customer connection when the `enterpriseId` for the customer is provided.

By specifying the requisition type `velocloud-customer` you can import all entities of a customer connection:

```
opennms:import-requisition velocloud-customer alias=aCustomerAlias
```

By specifying the requisition type `velocloud-partner` you can import all entities of a partner connection:

```
opennms:import-requisition velocloud-partner alias=aPartnerAlias
```

A customer requisition can be created using a partner connection alias by providing the `enterpriseId` as an additional parameter.
The following example demonstrates the creation of a customer requisition by using a partner alias and an additional Â´enterpriseId` parameter with the value set to `123`.

```
opennms:import-requisition velocloud-customer alias=aPartnerAlias,enterpriseId=123
```
