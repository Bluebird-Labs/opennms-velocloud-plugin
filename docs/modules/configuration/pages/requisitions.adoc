In order to monitor the *Velocloud* Gateways, Edges and Links, these entities need to be imported into *OpenNMS*.
You can achieve this by creating a requisition for a given connection alias.

By specifying the requisition type `velocloud-customer` you can import all entities of a customer connection:

```
import-requisition velocloud-customer alias=aCustomerAlias
```

By specifying the requisition type `velocloud-partner` you can import all entities of a partner connection:

```
import-requisition velocloud-partner alias=aPartnerAlias
```
